# Portfolio
My Portfolio Page!

Welcome to my portfolio page! This project is actually my portfolio, and its planned to show my abilities to us React. In this portfolio you will find my most recent Web Projects as well as links and to my GitHub Page and LinkedIn Profile. In the near future, I will be adding content for my Game Dev projects. 

For this portfolio I used the following:

* React
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* JQuery
* Materialize

There are two new things I tried on this: 

* Making a Generic NavBar
* Making a Generic Footer
