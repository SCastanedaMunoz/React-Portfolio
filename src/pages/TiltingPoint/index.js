            <hr />
            <p>I have been working at Tilting Point Media since March 2019; there, I have been in the role of Client Engineer supporting all of the games that include the Tilting Point SDK.
            I have been directly involved in the development and production of the Tilting Point SDK. Taking it from a monolithic legacy unity package, to a easily distributable package based SDK, where developers only need to integrate the features they need.
            Such features can include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i class="tiny material-icons">chevron_right</i>Analytics (Amplitude, Adjust, AppsFlyer, Leanplum, etc.)</li>
                <li><i class="tiny material-icons">chevron_right</i>Customer Support (Helpshift)</li>
                <li><i class="tiny material-icons">chevron_right</i>Live Ops (Leanplum, Swrve)</li>
                <li><i class="tiny material-icons">chevron_right</i>Adtervising (AdMob, IronSource, Vungle)</li>
                <li><i class="tiny material-icons">chevron_right</i>CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)</li>
                <li><i class="tiny material-icons">chevron_right</i>Purchasing (Unity IAP, Google Billing Library)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
             Due to the nature of the job, I have had the opportunity to learn no only Unity Game Development practices with C#, but I have had deep development cycles with more languages, such as: Java, C++, Objective-C, YAML, etc.
             Also, during this time I have also learned about full stack web development, so I have had experience with JavaScript, React, MongoDB, SQL, etc.   
            </p>

            <br/>
            <p>Whilst working at Tilting Point Media, I have contributed to the production, development and support of multiple games. As such, I have been able to experience all the multiple steps a game can go through, from alpha and prototyping, to closed betas and selected publishing, to full on global releases.
            Some of the best games I have been involved can be seen below.
